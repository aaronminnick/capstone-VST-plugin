# VST Multi-Comb Filter Plugin

This is my capstone project for [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/), to develop a VST audio plugin implementing multiple comb filters, for use in any DAW software.

The plugin utilizes the [JUCE](https://www.juce.com) framework.

This project is currently on hiatus as I work on expanding my portfolio and knowledge-set in pursuit of a junior development role. Once finished, this readme will be updated to include instructions for installation and use of the plugin. In the meantime, If you are interested in considering me for a position, please don't hesitate to message me on github or to [send me an email](mailto:abminnick@gmail.com).
